# Question
When would you want to use `.innerHTML` to create some new html, and when would you want to use `.createElement` and node updates?

# Answer

I would use `.innerHTML` for quick, simple addition or replacement of HTML content within an element. For example, when there's a need to quickly add or replace HTML content within an element, especially if the content is straightforward and doesn't demand extensive manipulation.

I would use `.createElement` and node updates for more control and flexibility over complex DOM manipulations and interactions. For example, in scenarios where there's a requirement to dynamically generate and modify complex DOM structures, or to update particular attributes or properties of DOM elements separately, or to manipulate DOM elements prior to appending them into the document.

In general, when I'm dealing with simple HTML content or just need to quickly update the content of an element, `.innerHTML` can be a convenient choice. However, if I'm working with more complex DOM manipulations or need finer control over the creation and manipulation of DOM elements, using `.createElement` and node updates would be more appropriate.
