# Question
Watch [this video on nodes and elements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhvec8cXLlo)

What is the difference between an HTMLCollections and NodeLists? Are they arrays?

# Answer
HTMLCollections and NodeLists differ in the methods they provide and in the types of nodes they can contain. While a NodeList can contain any node type (element, attribute, and text nodes), an HTMLCollection only contains element nodes. 

HTMLCollections are live collections where updating something automatically changes the DOM. HTMLCollection items can be accessed by their name, id, or index number. 

NodeLists, on the other hand, is most often a static collection. For example, if you add a `li` element to a list in the DOM, the list in NodeList will not change. NodeList items can only be accessed by their index number (index starts at 0).
