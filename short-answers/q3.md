# Question
What's the difference between `.innerText` and `.textContent`?

# Answer

`.innerText` retrieves and sets the rendered text content of an element, considering visibility and styling, while `.textContent` retrieves and sets the full text content of an element, including all text nodes, regardless of visibility or styling.

We should use `.innerText` if we need to manipulate the visible text content of an element and want to ensure that CSS styling and visibility are taken into account. 

We should use `.textContent` if we need to manipulate the raw text content of an element, including all text nodes regardless of visibility.
